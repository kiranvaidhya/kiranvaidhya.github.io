## Kiran Vaidhya Venkadesh 

I'm a PhD candidate at at the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](http://www.diagnijmegen.nl/index.php/Home) in Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. I'm working on lung nodule characterization under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Bram van Ginneken](http://www.diagnijmegen.nl/index.php/Bram_van_Ginneken), [Prof. Dr. Mathias Prokop](http://diagnijmegen.nl/index.php/Person?name=Mathias_Prokop) and [Dr. Colin Jacobs](http://www.diagnijmegen.nl/index.php/Colin_Jacobs).

My research interests revolve around medical image analysis and deep learning with an emphasis on temporal analysis. I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in the Engineering Design department at IIT Madras, in 2016, with a specialization in Biomedical Design. My Master's thesis was on brain tumor segmentation using deep learning. I worked at the [MiRL](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~gankrish/) lab under the supervision of Dr. Ganapathy Krishnamurthi. 
After my graduation, I worked at [Predible](http://predible.com/) as an AI Scientist and developed deep learning solutions for medical image analysis for the Indian healthcare system.

### Lung

#### Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Radboudumc
Lung cancer screening is being rolled out worldwide. [Aberle et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-019-0231-3?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nrclinonc%2Frss%2Fcurrent+%28Nature+Reviews+Clinical+Oncology+-+Issue%29&post_id=noID) reiterate the efficacy of screening high risk population with low-dose CT scans for lung cancer. My research interests revolve around early lung cancer detection on low-dose chest CT scans with an emphasis on temporal analysis using medical image analysis techniques.
